~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CHALLENGES~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Because I'm not really good at CSS coding so I chose Bootstrap to help me create the layout.
- Custom CSS => put under Bootstrap to overide the preset.
- The hamburger menu is not working on Work and Contact page so I learned that I had to include Boostrap template in every pages.
- At first, I planned to create a one page web portfolio but it turned out that the entire thing doesn't look good so I separated it into different pages.
- My mock-up includes a lot of appealling design elements, but they are too complicated for coding so I had to fix the design.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~WHAT I LEARNED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Getting familiar with inspector and developing tool.
- When designing the interface, we should consider the feasibility of developing it.
- IMD website, W3schools, Stackoverflow are my tutors.
- Using framework to save some time on coding
